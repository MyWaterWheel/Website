            <h2>Why Use this App</h2>
            <p>
                This App was built by an actual commercial real-estate owner who needed a tool to help manage a growing portfolio while on the go. For us, it's all about being mobile and keeping it simple! We believe there are already plenty of established tools for things like accounting, banking, and tenant communication. Why pay for what you don't need?
                This App was built for the owner and or property manager that needs everything for their buildings in the palm of their hand.
                This App allows you to be efficient so you can do more and Hustle Harder!!
